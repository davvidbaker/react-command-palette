# react-commander

## Local Dev

```
npm install
npm start
```

Things I could abstract, if there is ever a need:

- styling
- using a modal (remove it)

... could make fuzzaldrin into a BYO filter ...

# TODO

- find a list of commands to use
- more stories instead of just the one
- eslint, testing, prettier, before commit
